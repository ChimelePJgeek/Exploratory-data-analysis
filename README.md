# Exploratory-data-analysis
EDA using Python
In this project I used a pairplot to visualize the relationship between different features in different species and also examined the body mass distribution within the classified species

The data analyzed was obtained from:
Gorman KB, Williams TD, Fraser WR (2014) Ecological Sexual Dimorphism and Environmental Variability within a Community of Antarctic Penguins (Genus Pygoscelis). PLoS ONE 9(3): e90081. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0090081
